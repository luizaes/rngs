## Random Number Generators

A simple program with different randomization methods that displays how each of them distributes 2000 numbers over a range of [0, 100]. 

Currently, there are 13 methods implemented (more methods are going to be added in the future):
* Uniform distribution
* Gaussian distribution
* Cauchy distribution
* Logistic map
* Circle map
* Gauss map
* Piecewise map
* Sine map
* Singer map
* Sinusoidal map
* Tent map
* Chebyshev map
* Iteractive map

### Run

First, clone this repository:

``` git clone https://github.com/luizaes/rngs.git rngs ```

Then, access the directory:

``` cd rngs ```

And build and execute the program:

``` make ```

``` make run ```

#### Dependencies
* GSL
* Boost
